* Features
The main interesting things that I have done here are my hacks with terminals and window tracking.

Features:
- only the active window has a border
- symlinking scripts/run_file allows the user to use run_file -f <filename> for python files and they will automatically pipe output (with colored error messages) asynchronously to a seperate terminal of your choosing.
- reloads necessary configuration on wake from sleep or suspend (support for docking while hibernating/asleep)
- launch a terminal to the same working directory as the currently active program
- many other little things that were much easier and less significant.
* Extras
** Useful tools
   - arandr - graphical monitor management
   - autorandr - automatic profile assignment
   - system-config-printer - manjaro GUI for cups (printers). RUN AS ROOT
   - okular - my current favourite PDF viewer
